# E-Commerce Platform with AI-Generative Features

## Description
This project is an **AI-powered e-commerce platform** built with Django that revolutionizes how sellers create product listings. Instead of manually writing descriptions and labels, sellers can simply upload a product photo, and our AI system will automatically:

- **Analyze product images** using computer vision
- **Generate detailed product descriptions** automatically
- **Suggest relevant product labels and tags** 
- **Identify product categories** based on visual content
- **Automate tedious listing creation** to save sellers hours of work

The platform provides a complete MVP with user authentication, AI-powered product management, and intelligent search capabilities.
